# Credit Card Check
Validates credit card numbers using the LUHN Formula (Mod 10).

Only accepts certain cards, therefore, even if the CC may pass the LUHN test, the CC may still be rejected.
See [test data](https://github.com/eccos/ccCheck/blob/master/notes%20and%20test%20accts.txt) for specifics.
